Machine Learning

a simple image classifier as a web app. 

You can use common objects or face/body gestures to capture images for each of the three classes. Each time you click 
one of the "Add" buttons, one image is added to that class as a training example. While you do this, the model continues 
to make predictions on webcam images coming in and shows the results in real-time.
